		A prime number is a number that is evenly divisible only by itself and 1. For example,
		the number 5 is prime number because it can be evenly divided only by 1 and 5. The
		number 6, however, is not prime number because it can be divided evenly by 1,2,3,and
		6.
		Write a method named isPrime which takes an integer as an argument and returns true if
		the argument is a prime number, or false otherwise.
		• Note: 0 and 1 are not prime numbers. The 2 is the only even prime number because all
		the other even numbers can be divided by 2
