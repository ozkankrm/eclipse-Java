A static method can be used without instantiating a class object.

like in the calculator class create a plus and minus. but this time make them static methods.

plus: gets two ints and returns the addition of the to numbers as an int

Calc.plus(1,1)
returns:2

Calc.plus(10,1)
returns:11

minus:  the same as plus its also static, but it returns the substructed value of the two ints it gets

Calc.minus(1,1)
returns:0

Calc.plus(10,1)
returns:9
